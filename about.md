He is a certified Product Manager and has designed financial services software solution since 2007.  Contact Management solutions he helped build are in direct competition with, and have been selected over salesforce.com at large financial institutions such as Regions Financial (Regions Bank) and Associated Bank.  Before that, he spent 15 years with Wells Fargo Bank.

Dave brings a passion for making the customer experience the best it can be.  His vision is for project creators to be able to maintain a growing base of customers as they endeavor to grow their portfolio to the point where crowd funding is no longer a necessity, but while small business owners rely on crowd funding, he will be at the forefront, sharing his experience to make their lives easier.  Through his experience with crowd funding his self-made board game company and his expertise in the field of sales and relationship management, Crowd Control is poised to be the first end to end to end crowd funding solution in the marketplace.

What is end to end to end? Well, crowd funding management solutions do a good job with pledge management and fulfillment, but they fall short in a key areaâ€¦business growth between projects.  Crowd Control will give you with ability to communicate and grow your business between crowd funding projects with a targeted suite of sales and relationship management functionality for the small business owner and project creator.
